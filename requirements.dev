# AWS test libs
# Pin all the AWS SDK libs provided by AWS lambda
# - see also lambda/layer_builds.sh and note that
#   all these libs are removed from lambda layers
# - adding them here as dev-deps could force poetry
#   and pip to constrain these versions when it tries to
#   resolve version compatibility for the app-deps;
#   without adding all these to the app-deps.
